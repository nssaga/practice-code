 * 
 * LinkedHashSet maintain the insertion order. Elements get sorted in the same
 * sequence in which they have been added.
 * 
 * not synchronized
 * 
 * no duplicates values
 * 
 * Keeping the insertion order in LinkedHashset have additional associated
 * costs, both in terms of spending additional CPU cycles and needing more
 * memory.
 * 
 * Insertion order is not affected if an element is re-inserted into the set.
