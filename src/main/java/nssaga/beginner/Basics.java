 * Why High level
 * 
 * They are called high-level because they are mostly independent of the
 * underlying processor on which they run. For example, they can run on Intel
 * processor and also on AMD processor. Means that the programmer who is coding
 * in any of these languages need not worry about the underlying processor.
