/**
 * When a method is called, a new stack frame gets created on the call stack.
 * This stack frame holds parameters of the invoked method, its local variables
 * and the return address of the method i.e. the point from which the method
 * execution should continue after the invoked method has returned.
 * 
 * The creation of stack frames will continue until it reaches the end of method
 * invocations found inside nested methods.
 * 
 * During this process, if JVM encounters a situation where there is no space
 * for a new stack frame to be created, it will throw a StackOverflowError.
 * 
 * The most common cause for the JVM to encounter this situation is
 * unterminated/infinite recursion â€“ the Javadoc description for
 * StackOverflowError mentions that the error is thrown as a result of too deep
 * recursion in a particular code snippet.
 * 
 * However, recursion is not the only cause for this error. It can also happen
 * in a situation where an application keeps calling methods from within methods
 * until the stack is exhausted. This is a rare case since no developer would
 * intentionally follow bad coding practices. Another rare cause is having a
 * vast number of local variables inside a method.
 * 
 * The StackOverflowError can also be thrown when an application is designed to
 * have cyclic relationships between classes. In this situation, the
 * constructors of each other are getting called repetitively which causes this
 * error to be thrown. This can also be considered as a form of recursion.
 * 
 * Another interesting scenario that causes this error is if a class is being
 * instantiated within the same class as an instance variable of that class.
 * This will cause the constructor of the same class to be called again and
 * again (recursively) which eventually results in a StackOverflowError.
