/**
 * Write a program to generate Fibonacci series in java. <br>
 * <br>
 * Example of fibonacci series in java - 0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34 55 89. <br>
 * <br>
 * 
 * First number of series is 0 & second number of series is 1. So, logic behind
 * the series generation is that the subsequent number generated is sum of
 * previous two number of series. <br>
 * <br>
 * 
 * Example of fibonacci series in java - First number of series is 0 & second
 * number of series is 1. So, third number will be 0+1=1 So, fourth number will
 * be 1+1=2 So, fifth number will be 2+1=3 and so onï¿½
